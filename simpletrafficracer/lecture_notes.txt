Project:

GrundsÃ¤tzlich:
 * Enforment learning,
oder
 * imitation learning
 * Or combine - start imitation and change later to reenforcement

State design - choose of: 
1) full image
2) state space that detect cars. Feature engeneering. Image processing allowed! (smaller matrix => faster). Color of cars is important for the behavior
3) Maybe hack the game engine to get the feature vector (cars). 

Tipp: Use 4 images (historic) - 3 color channels. Use Keras as lib.

What use as revard function?
What use as the network architecture?

Deadline: End of July
