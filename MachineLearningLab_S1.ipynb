Many big technology providers including Google, IBM, Microsoft and Facebook have entered the race to provide the best and most popluar frameworks. To enter such a race, mainly four features are considered in the provided framework:\n","\n","1. Uses a popular language for data scientists (Python, Scale, C++ or R)\n","2. Flexible in creating and adjusting deep learning architectures -> Functional programming\n","3. Easy for computing gradients\n","4. Interface with GPUs for parallel processing\n","\n","\n","In the following we see the most popular provided deep learning frameworks with their providers\n","https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-framework-power-scores-2018-23607ddf297a\n","\n","![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dYjDEI0mLpsCOySKUuX1VA.png)\n","\n","## Tensorflow\n","TensorFlow is the undisputed heavyweight champion. It has the most GitHub activity, Google searches, Medium articles, books on Amazon and ArXiv articles. It also has the most developers using it and is listed in the most online job descriptions. TensorFlow is backed by Google.\n","\n","## Keras\n","Keras has an “API designed for human beings, not machines.” It is the second most popular framework in nearly all evaluation areas. Keras sits on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. Start with Keras if you are new to deep learning.\n","\n","## Pytorch\n","\n","PyTorch is the third most popular overall framework and the second most popular stand-alone framework. It is younger than TensorFlow and has grown rapidly in popularity. It allows customization that TensorFlow does not. It has the backing of Facebook.\n","\n","## Theano\n","\n","Theano was developed at the University of Montreal in 2007 and is the oldest significant Python deep learning framework. It has lost much of its popularity and its leader stated that major releases were no longer on the roadmap. However, updates continue to be made. Theano still the fifth highest scoring framework.\n","\n","# Comparision:\n","\n","## Criteria 1: Online Job Listings\n","\n","TensorFlow is the clear winner when it comes to frameworks mentioned in job listings.
